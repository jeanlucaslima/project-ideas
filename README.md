# Project ideas
Ideas to build your own portfolio or to learn a new language/stack/framework

## Projects list
I didn't try to categorize (yet) in any way. Just throwing ideas.

#### Learning the basics

* Data structures and basic algorithms:
  * List, Array, Heap, Queue - includes linked lists, double linked lists, FIFO
  * Trees and its algorithms:
    * Binary tree [insert, delete, search, traverse]
    * Red-black tree [insert, delete, search, traverse]
    * B tree [insert, delete, search, traverse]
    * Suffix tree [insert, delete, search, traverse]
  * Sorting algorithms:
    * [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
    * [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
    * [Heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
    * [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
    * [Shell sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_sort)
    * [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
  * Graph algorithms:
    * [Coloring algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring)
    * [Topological sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)
    * [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
    * [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
    * Shortest path - [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
* Evolutionary algorithms
  * Genetic algorithm project ideas:
    * [Shortest path on graph](http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/applying-a-genetic-algorithm-to-the-travelling-salesman-problem/5) with ant-colony optimization
    * Finding square root of a number by trial
* Machine Learning and Data Mining
  * [Artificial Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) - a software to recognize if a flower is a flower from a set of images they can learn.
  * [Natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) - create a simple bot to talk to you

#### Portfolio-potential projects, web applications, apps (desktop, mobile, others)

* Chat app - a standard project that can be done in lots of ways, for example:
  * Interface - UI/UX for a chat application
  * WebRTC chat - focusing more on the backend
  * Video chat
  * An IRC client
* Imageboard/Forum
* Build a Chrome extension
  * To screenshot the entire page
  * To change the homepage
  * To block a user to access a certain website (example: Facebook-blocker)
  * To play a youtube video on the corner of the browser window
* A simple CMS (or blog) engine
* Scraping - a project to scrub some data of a website (e.g. references from a wikipedia article)
* Todo app - a app with tasks that can have multiple status (done, to do, doing)
  * Worth checking: [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/) with examples in multiples MV* frameworks
* Slack/IRC bots - a simple bot to:
  * Collect links that are posted on a channel
  * Have a conversation
  * Show stock prices
  * Show weather when called (e.g. "bot, weather in New York")
  * Give a result from wikipedia (e.g. "bot, search wikipedia History of alternate reality games")
  * A Radio - returns a youtube video from a queue or from a search term
* Startup clones:
  * AirBnB-like project - a place to upload the description of something, with photos, and a map. Also a view to display it.
  * Simple social media - a website with user profile and content that goes to a "stream".
  * Tinder-like project - a "swipe to decide" app
  * Etsy-like project - an ecommerce
  * Slack-like application - a software for communication inside of a team
  * Wikipedia-like application - a website with edition of articles (user authentication optional)
* Hardware automation (suggested to use [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)/[Banana pi](http://www.bananapi.org/)/[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)/[Particle](https://www.particle.io/)/[FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)/others)
  * Irrigation system based on the grass color (computer vision)
  * [Brew your own Beer](http://www.brewpi.com/)
